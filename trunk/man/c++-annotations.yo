manpagename(cpp-annotations)(Frank Brokken's C++ Annotations)

manpagedescription()

The bf(C++) Annotations offer an extensive tutorial about the bf(C++)
programming language. It can be used as a textbook for bf(C/C++) programming
courses. A translation of this document (included in this package) is
available in Portugese.

This document is intended for knowledgeable users of bf(C) (or any other
language using a bf(C)-like grammar, like bf(Perl) or bf(Java)) who would like
to know more about, or make the transition to, bf(C++). This document is the
main textbook for Frank's bf(C++) programming courses, which are yearly
organized at the University of Groningen, the Netherlands.

The bf(C++) Annotations do not cover all aspects of bf(C++), though. In
particular, bf(C++)'s basic grammar, which is, for all practical purposes,
equal to bf(C)'s grammar, is not covered. For this part of the bf(C++)
language, the reader should consult other texts, like a book covering the
bf(C) programming language.

The package offers the bf(C++) Annotations in the following document formats:
    itemization(
    it() Plain ascii text (tt(cplusplus.txt));
    it() LaTeX(), including a tt(.dvi) file (in the subdirectory tt(latex/));
    it() PostScript (in the subdirectory tt(ps/));
    it() Pdf (in the subdirectory tt(pdf/));
    it() html (in the subdirectory tt(html/));
    )
    The postscript, pdf and LaTeX() formats were constructed for two different
paper-sizes: A4 and legal.

    Depending on your installation type, the documents may also appear in
compressed forms (e.g., tt(cplusplus.txt.gz, cplusplus.html.zip)).
