Here is an example of a completely specialized tt(CirQue) class, specialized
for a tt(vector<int>). All members of the specialized class are declared, but
only non-trivial implementations of its members are provided. The specialized
class uses a copy of the tt(vector) passed to the constructor and implements a
circular queue using its tt(vector) data member:
    verbinclude(examples/cirquevector.h)

The next example shows how to use the specialized tt(CirQue) class:
    verbinsert(MAIN)(examples/cirquevector.cc)
