Several functions called from the grammar are defined as template
functions. tt(Bisonc++) generates multiple files, among which the file
defining the parser's class. Functions called from the production rule's
action blocks are usually member functions of the parser. These member
functions must be declared and defined. Once tt(bisonc++) has generated the
header file defining the parser's class it will not automatically rewrite that
file, allowing the programmer to add new members to the parser class once they
are required. Here is the tt(parser.h) file as used in our little calculator:
        verbinclude(concrete/bisonc++/parser/parser.h)
