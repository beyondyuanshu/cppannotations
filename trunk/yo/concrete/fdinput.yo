    When classes for input operation are derived from ti(std::streambuf), they
should be provided with an input buffer of at least one character. The
one-character input buffer allows for the use of the member functions
tt(istream::putback) or tt(istream::ungetc).  Strictly speaking it is not
necessary to implement a buffer in classes derived from tt(streambuf). But
using buffers in these classes is strongly advised. Their implementation is
very simple and straightforward and the applicability of such classes will be
greatly improved. Therefore, in all our classes derived from the class
tt(streambuf) a buffer of em(at least) one character will be defined.
