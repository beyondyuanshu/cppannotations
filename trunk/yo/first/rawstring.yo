Standard ASCII-C strings are delimited by double quotes, supporting
 hi(escape sequence) escape sequences like tt(\n, \\) and tt(\"). In some
cases it is useful to avoid escaping strings (e.g., in the context of XML). To
this end, the C++0x standard offers hi(raw string literal) em(raw string
literals).

Raw string literals start with an tt(R), followed by a double quote, followed
by a label (which is an arbitrary sequence of characters not equal to tt([)),
followed by tt([). The raw string ends at the closing bracket tt(]), followed
by the label which is in turn followed by a double quote. Example:
        verb(
    R"[A Raw \ "String"]"
    R"delimiter[Another \ Raw "[String]]delimiter"
        )
    In the first case, everything between tt("[) and tt(]") is part of the
string. Escape sequences aren't supported so tt(\ ") defines three characters:
a backslash, a blank character and a double quote. The second example shows a
raw string defined between the markers tt("delimiter[) and tt(]delimiter").
