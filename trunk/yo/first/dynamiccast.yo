Finally there is a new style cast that is used in combination with
polymorphism (see chapter ref(POLYMORPHISM)). Its syntax is:
                    centt(dynamic_cast<type>(expression))
 It is used at run-time to convert a pointer to an object of some class (e.g.,
tt(Base)) to a pointer to an object of another class (e.g., tt(Derived)) which
is found further down its so-called em(class hierarchy) (this is also called
em(downcasting)). At this point in the em(Annotations) a tt(dynamic_cast)
cannot yet be discussed extensively, but we return to this topic in section
ref(DYNAMICCAST).
