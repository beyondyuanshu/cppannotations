At times (cf. section ref(TEMPLIST)) an empty
        hi(empty struct)hi(struct: empty)hi(NullType)
    tt(struct) is a useful tool. It can be used as a em(type) acting
analogously to the ti(ASCII-Z) (final 0-byte) in bf(C)-strings.
It can simply be defined as:
        verb(
    struct NullType
    {};
        )
