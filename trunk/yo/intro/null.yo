In bf(C++) all zero values are coded as tt(0). In bf(C), where pointers are
concerned, ti(NULL) is often used. This difference is purely stylistic, though
one that is widely adopted. In bf(C++) there's no need anymore to use
tt(NULL), and using tt(0) is actually preferred when indicating null-pointer
values.
