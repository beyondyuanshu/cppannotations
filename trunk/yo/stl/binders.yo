em(Binders) hi(binder) are function adaptors converting
 hi(binary function object) binary function objects to
 hi(unary function object) unary function objects. They do so by em(binding)
one parameter of a binary function object to a constant value. For example,
the first parameter of the tt(minus<int>) function object may be bound to 100,
meaning that the resulting value is always equal to 100 minus the value of the
function object's second argument.

Either the first or the second parameter may be bound to a specific value. To
bind the constant value to the function object's first parameter the function
adaptor ti(bind1st) is used. To bind the constant value to the function
object's second parameter the function adaptor ti(bind2nd) is used. As an
example, assume we want to count all elements of a vector of tt(string)
objects that occur later in the alphabetical ordering than some reference
tt(string).

The ti(count_if) generic algorithm is the algorithm of choice for solving
these kinds of problems. It expects the usual iterator range and a function
object. However, instead of providing it with a function object it is provided
with the tt(bind2nd) adaptor which in turn is initialized with a relational
function object (tt(greater<string>)) and a reference string against which all
strings in the iterator range are compared. Here is the required tt(bind2nd)
specification:
        verb(
    bind2nd(greater<string>(), referenceString)
        )
    Here is what this binder does:
    itemization(
    it() To begin with, an adaptor (and so a binder) is a function object, so
it defines tt(operator()). In this case the binder function object is a
em(unary) function object.
    it() The binder's tt(operator()) receives each of the strings referred to
by the iterator range in turn.
    it() Next it passes these strings and the binder's second argument (the
reference object) to the (binary) tt(operator()) defined by the function
object that is passed as the binder's first argument.
    it() It returns the return value of that latter function object
    )
    Although binders are defined as templates, it is illustrative to have a
look at their implementations, assuming they were ordinary classes. Here is
such a pseudo-implementation of the tt(bind2nd) function adaptor:
        verb(
    class bind2nd
    {
        FunctionObject d_object;
        Operand const &d_operand;
        public:
            bind2nd(FunctionObject const &object, Operand const &operand);
            ReturnType operator()(Operand const &lvalue);
    };
    inline bind2nd::bind2nd(FunctionObject const &object,
                            Operand const &operand)
    :
        d_object(object),
        d_operand(operand)
    {}
    inline ReturnType bind2nd::operator()(Operand const &lvalue)
    {
        return d_object(lvalue, d_operand);
    }
        )
    The binder's tt(operator()) merely calls the function object's
tt(operator()), providing it with two arguments. It uses its parameter as the
(latter) tt(operator())'s first argument and it uses tt(d_operand) as
tt(operator())'s second argument.  The adaptor's members are typically very
small so they are usually implemented inline.

    The above application of the tt(bind2nd) adaptor has another important
characteristic. Its return type is identical to the return type of the
function object that it receives as its first argument, which is
tt(bool). Functions hi(predicate function) returning tt(bool) values are also
called em(predicate functions). In the above application the tt(bind2nd)
adaptor therefore becomes a predicate function itself.

    The tt(count_if) generic algorithm visits all the elements in an iterator
range, returning the number of times the predicate specified as its final
argument returns ti(true). Each of the elements of the iterator range is
passed to this predicate, which is therefore a unary predicate. Through the
binder the binary function object tt(greater<>) is adapted to a unary function
object, that now compares each of the elements referred to by the iterator
range to the reference string.  Eventually, the tt(count_if) function is
called like this:
        verb(
    count_if(stringVector.begin(), stringVector.end(),
             bind2nd(greater<string>(), referenceString));
        )
