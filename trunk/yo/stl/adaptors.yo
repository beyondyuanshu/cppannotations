Function adaptors modify the working of existing function objects. The STL
offers three kinds of hi(function adaptor) function adaptors: binders,
negators and member function wrappers. Binders and negators are described in
the next two subsections; member function adaptors are covered in section
ref(MEMFUNADAPT) of the next chapter, which is a more natural point of
coverage than the current chapter.
