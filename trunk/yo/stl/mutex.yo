    The C++0x standard offers a series of i(mutex) classes to protect shared
data.  Before using mutexes the tthi(mutex) header file must have been
included.

Apart from the tt(std::mutex) class hi(recursive_mutex)
tt(std::recursive_mutex) is offered.  When a tt(recursive_mutex) is called
multiple times by the same thread it will increase its lock-count. Before
other threads may access the protected data the recursive mutex must be
unlocked again that number of times. In addition the classes hi(timed_mutex)
tt(std::timed_mutex) and
 hi(recursive_timed_mutex)tt(std::recursive_timed_mutex) are available. Their
locks will (also) expire after a preset amount of time.

    In many situations locks will be released at the end of some action
block. To simplify locking additional template classes
 hi(unique_lock) tt(std::unique_lock<>) and hi(lock_guard)
tt(std::lock_guard<>) are provided. As their constructors lock the data and
their destructors unlock the data they can be defined as local variables,
unlocking their data once their scope terminates.  Here is a simple example
showing the use of a tt(lock_guard). Once tt(safeProcess) ends tt(guard) is
destroyed, thereby releasing the lock on tt(data):
        verb(
    std::mutex dataMutex;
    Data data;

    void safeProcess()
    {
        std::lock_guard<std::mutex> guard(dataMutex);
        process(data);
    }
        )
    tt(Unique_lock) is used similarly, but is used when timeouts must be
considered as well:
        verb(
    std::timed_mutex dataMutex;
    Data data;

    void safeProcess()
    {
        std::unique_lock<std::timed_mutex>
            guard(dataMutex, std::chrono::milliseconds(3));
        if (guard)
            process(data);
    }
        )
    In the above example tt(guard) tries to obtain the lock during three
milliseconds. If tt(guard)'s tt(operator bool) returns tt(true) the lock was
obtained and tt(data) can be processed safely.

 hi(deadlock) em(Deadlocks) are commonly encountered in multi threaded
programs. If a deadlock occurs when two locks are required to process data,
but one thread obtains the first lock and another thread obtains the second
lock. The C++0x standard defines a generic
 hi(lock)tt(std::lock) function that can be used to prevent problems like
these. The tt(std::lock) function can be used to lock multiple mutexes in one
atomic action. Here is an example:
        verb(
    struct SafeString
    {
        std::mutex  d_mutex;
        std::string d_text;
    };

    void calledByThread(SafeString &first, SafeString &second)
    {
        std::unique_lock<std::mutex>                        // 1
                lock_first(first.d_mutex, std::defer_lock);

        std::unique_lock<std::mutex>                        // 2
                lock_second(second.d_mutex, std::defer_lock);

        std::lock(lock_first, lock_second);                 // 3

        safeProcess(first.d_text, second.d_text);
    }
        )
    At 1 and 2 tt(unique_locks) are created. Locking is deferred until calling
tt(std::lock) at 3. Having obtained the lock, the two tt(SafeString) text
members can both be safely processed by tt(calledByThread).

Another problematic issue with threads involves initialization. If multiple
threads are running and only the first thread encountering the initialization
code should perform the initialization then this problem should not be solved
using mutexes. Although proper synchronization is realized, the
synchronization will also be performed time and again for every thread. The
C++0x standard offers several ways to perform a proper initialization:
    itemization(
    it() First, a emi(constexpr) em(constructor) may be defined. Constexpr
constructors are currently not yet supported by the tt(g++) compiler and they
are not yet discussed in the annotations().
    COMMENT(
First, suppose your constructor is declared with the new constexpr keyword and
satisfies the requirements for constant initialization. In this case, an
object of static storage duration, initialized with that constructor, is
guaranteed to be initialized before any code is run as part of the static
initialization phase. This is the option chosen for std::mutex, because it
eliminates the possibility of race conditions with initialization of mutexes
at a global scope:


class my_class
    {
        int i;

    public:
        constexpr my_class():i(0){}

        my_class(int i_):i(i_){}

        void do_stuff();
    };

    my_class x; // static initialization with constexpr constructor

    int foo();
    my_class y(42+foo()); // dynamic initialization

    void f()
    {
        y.do_stuff(); // is y initialized?
    }
        END)

    it() Second, a static variable defined within a compound statement may be
used (e.g., a static local variable within a function body).  In C++ static
variables hi(static variable: initialization) defined within a compund
statement are initialized the first time the function is called at the point
in the code where the static variable is defined as illustrated by the
following example:
        verbinclude(stl/examples/staticlocal.cc)
    This feature causes a thread to wait automatically if another thread is
still initializing the static data (note that em(non-static) data never cause
problems, as each non-static local variables have lifes that are completely
restricted to their own threads).
    it() If the above two approaches can't be used. The combined use of
 hi(call_once)tt(std::call_once) and hi(once_flag) tt(std::once_flag) result
in one-time execution of a specified function as illustrated by the next
example:
        verb(
    std::string *global;
    std::once_flag globalFlag;

    void initializeGlobal()
    {
        global = new std::string("Hello world (why not?)");
    }
    void safeUse()
    {
        std::call_once(globalFlag, initializeGlobal);
        process(*global);
    }
        )
    )
