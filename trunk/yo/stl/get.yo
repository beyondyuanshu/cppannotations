The member function hi(auto_ptr<>::get()) tt(get()) of an tt(auto_ptr) object
returns the underlying pointer. The value returned by tt(get()) is a pointer
to the underlying data-type. It may be hi(pointer: in auto_ptr objects)
inspected: if it's zero the tt(auto_ptr) object does not point to any memory.

The member function tt(get()) cannot be used to let the tt(auto_ptr) object
point to (another) block of memory. Instead the member function
hi(auto_ptr<>::reset()) tt(reset()), discussed in the next section, should be
used.
