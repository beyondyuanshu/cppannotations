Most often a tt(shared_ptr) hi(shared_ptr: initialization) is initialized by a
dynamically allocated block of memory. The generic form is:
        verb(
    shared_ptr<type [, deleter_type]> identifier(new-expression
            [, deleter = deleter_type()]);
        )
    The second (template) argument (tt(deleter(_type))) is optional and may
 hi(deleter) refer to a free function or function object handling the
destruction of the allocated memory. A deleter is used, e.g., in situations
where a double pointer is allocated and the destruction must visit each nested
pointer to destroy the allocated memory (see below for an illustration).  It
is used in situations comparable to those encountered with tt(unique_ptr)
(cf. section ref(UNIQUENEW)).

    Here is an example initializing an tt(shared_ptr) pointing to a tt(string)
object:
        verb(
    shared_ptr<string> strPtr(new string("Hello world"));
        )
    The argument that is passed to the constructor is the pointer returned by
tt(operator new). Note that tt(type) does em(not) mention the pointer.  The
hi(shared_ptr: used type) type that is used in the tt(shared_ptr) construction
is the same as the type that is used in tt(new) expressions.

The example illustrates that two tt(shared_ptrs) indeed share their
information. After modifying the information controlled by one of the
objects the information controlled by the other object is modified as well:
        verbinclude(stl/examples/sharedinsert.cc)
