To format information to be inserted  into a stream the member tt(form()) is
available:
    centt(ostream& form(const char *format, ...);)
Note that this is a em(member-function), returning a reference to an
tt(ostream) object. Therefore, it can be used in combination with, e.g., the
insertion operator:
    centt(cout.form("Hello %s", "world") << '\n';)
produces a well known sentence.

The member function tt(form()) is the analogue of bf(C)'s tt(fprintf())
function. When variadic functions are constructed in which information must be
inserted into a stream, the member function tt(vform()) can be used, being the
analogue of tt(vfprintf()).

To scan information from a stream, the member function tt(scan()) can be
used, which is the analogue of bf(C)'s tt(fscanf()) function. Similarly to
tt(vfscanf()), the member function tt(vscan()) can be used in variadic
functions.
