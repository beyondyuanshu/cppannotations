In order to be able to create tt(fstream) objects, the header file
tt(fstream) must be included. Files to read are accessed through
tt(ifstream) objects, files to write are accessed through tt(ofstream) objects.
Files may be accessed for reading and writing as well. The general tt(fstream)
object is used for that purpose.

String stream objects can be used to read or write objects to streams in
memory, allowing the use of, e.g., the insertion and extraction operators on
these objects. To use the string stream objects tt(istrstream, ostrstream) or
tt(strstream) the header file tt(strstream) must be included. Note that a
tt(strstream) object is not a tt(string) object. A tt(strstream) object should
be approached like a tt(fstream) object, not as a tt(char *) object having
special characteristics.
