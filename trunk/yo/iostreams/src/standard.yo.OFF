In bf(C) three standard files are available: tt(stdin), the standard input
stream, normally connected to the keyboard, tt(stdout), the (buffered) standard
output stream, normally connected to the screen, and tt(stderr), the
(unbuffered) standard error stream, normally not redirected, and also connected
to the screen.

In bf(C++) comparable iostreams are
startit()
    it() tt(cin), an tt(istream) object from which information can be
        extracted. This stream is normally connected to the keyboard.
    it() tt(cout), an tt(ostream) object, into which information can be
        inserted. This stream is normally connected to the screen.
    it() tt(cerr), an tt(ostream) object, into which information can be
        inserted. This stream is normally connected to the screen. Insertions
        into that stream are unbuffered.
    it() tt(clog), an tt(ostream) object, comparable to tt(cerr), but using
        buffered insertions. Again, this stream is normally connected to the
        screen.
endit()
