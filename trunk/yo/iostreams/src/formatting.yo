While the insertion and extraction operators provide elegant ways to
read information from and write information to tt(iostreams), there
are situations in which special formating is required. Formating may
involve the control of the width of an output field or an input buffer
or the form (e.g., the radix) in which a value is displayed. The
functions tt((v)form()) and tt((v)scan()) can be used for special formating.
Although these latter functions are not available in all implementations, they
em(are) available with the tt(GNU g++) run-time system.

Apart from these member functions, member functions are available for defining
the precision and the way numbers are displayed. Apart from using members,
em(manipulators) exist for controlling the display form and the width of
output and input elements. Different from member functions, manipulators are
part of insertion or extraction statements.
