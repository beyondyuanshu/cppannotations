        itemization(
            it() The first prototype: an iterator into the first range
rangett(first1, last1) is returned where the elements in the range
rangett(first2, last2) are found using ti(operator==) of the data
type to which the iterators point. If no such location exists, tt(last1) is
returned.
            it() The second prototype: an iterator into the first range
rangett(first1, last1) is returned where the elements in the range
rangett(first2, last2) are found using the provided binary predicate tt(pred)
to compare the elements in the two ranges. If no such location exists,
tt(last1) is returned.
