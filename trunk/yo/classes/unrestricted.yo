The C++0x standard allows unions to be defined consisting of objects for
which a non-trivial constructor is defined. The example illustrates how such
an emi(unrestricted union) may be defined. The data field tt(u_string) is an
object of the class tt(std::string) for which non-trivial constructors are
available:
        verb(
    union Union
    {
        int u_int;
        double u_double;
        std::string u_string;
    };
        )
