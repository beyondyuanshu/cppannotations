The possibility to pass arguments to constructors allows us to monitor the
construction of objects during a program's execution.  This is shown in the
next listing, using a class tt(Test). The program listing below shows a class
tt(Test), a global tt(Test) object, and two local tt(Test) objects: in a
function tt(func()) and in the tt(main()) function. The order of construction
is as expected: first global, then main's first local object, then
tt(func())'s local object, and then, finally, tt(main())'s second local
object:
