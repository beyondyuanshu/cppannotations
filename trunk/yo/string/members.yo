The tt(std::string) class offers many member function as well as additional
non-member functions that should be considered part of the string class.
All these functions are listed below in alphabetic order.

The symbolic value tt(string::npos) is defined by the string class. It
represents `index-not-found' when returned by member functions returning
string offset positions. Example: when calling `tt(object.find('x'))' (see
below) on a string object not containing the character tt('x'), tt(npos)
is returned, as the requested position does not exist.

The final 0-byte used in bf(C) strings to indicate the end of an ASCII-Z
string is em(not) considered part of a bf(C++) string, and so the member
function will return tt(npos), rather than tt(length()) when looking for 0 in
a string object containing the characters of a bf(C) string.

Here are the standard functions that operate on objects of the class
string. When a parameter of tt(size_t) is mentioned it may be interpreted as a
parameter of type tt(string::size_type), but without defining a default
argument value. The type tt(size_type) should be read as
tt(string::size_type). With tt(size_type) the default argument values
mentioned in section ref(STRINGOVERVIEW) apply. All quoted functions are
member functions of the class tt(std::string), except where indicated
otherwise.
    itemization(
    ithtq(at)(char &at(size_t opos))
       (a reference to the character at the indicated position is
        returned. When called with tt(string const) objects a tt(char const &)
        is returned. The member function performs range-checking, raising an
        exception (that by default aborts the program) if an invalid index is
        passed.)
    ithtq(append)
        (string &append(InputIterator begin, InputIterator end))
        (the characters in the range defined by tt(begin) and tt(end) are
        appended to the current string object.)
    ittq(string &append(string const &argument, size_type apos,
        size_type an))
        (tt(argument) (or a substring) is appended to the current string
        object.)
    ittq(string &append(char const *argument, size_type an))
       (the first tt(an) characters of tt(argument) are appended to the
        string object.)
    ittq(string &append(size_type n, char ch))
       (tt(n) characters tt(ch) are appended to the current string object.)
    ithtq(assign)(string &assign(string const &argument, size_type
        apos, size_type an))
       (tt(argument) (or a substring) is assigned to the string object.
        If tt(argument) is of type tt(char const *) and one additional
        argument is provided the second argument is interpreted as a value
        initializing tt(an), using 0 to initialize tt(apos).)
    ittq(string &assign(size_type n, char ch))
       (tt(n) characters tt(ch) are assigned to the current string object.)
    ithtq(capacity)(size_type capacity() const)
       (the number of characters that can currently be stored in the string
        object without needing to resize it is returned.)
    ithtq(compare)(int compare(string const &argument) const)
       (the text stored in the current string object and the text stored in
        tt(argument) is compared using a lexicographical comparison using the
        ASCII character collating sequence. zero is returned if the two
        strings have identical contents, a negative value is returned if the
        text in the current object should be ordered em(before) the text in
        tt(argument); a positive value is returned if the text in the current
        object should be ordered em(beyond) the text in tt(argument).)
    ittq(int compare(size_t opos, size_t on, string const &argument) const)
       (a substring of the text stored in the current string object is
        compared to the text stored in tt(argument). At most tt(on) characters
        starting at offset tt(opos) are compared to the text in tt(argument).)
    itt(int compare+OPENPARsize_t opos, size_t on, string const &argument,)
        linebreak()
       tt(size_type apos, size_type an+CLOSEPAR):
       quote(a substring of the text stored in the current string object is
        compared to a substring of the text stored in tt(argument). At most
        tt(on) characters of the current string object, starting at offset
        tt(opos), are compared to at most tt(an) characters of tt(argument),
        starting at offset tt(apos). In this case tt(argument) em(must) be a
        string object.)
    ittq(int compare(size_t opos, size_t on, char const *argument, size_t an))
       (a substring of the text stored in the current string object is
        compared to a substring of the text stored in tt(argument). At most
        tt(on) characters of the current string object starting at offset
        tt(opos) are compared to at most tt(an) characters of
        tt(argument). tt(Argument) must have at least tt(an) characters. The
        characters may have arbitrary values: the ASCII-Z value has no special
        meaning.)
    ithtq(copy)(size_t copy(char *argument, size_t on, size_type opos) const)
       (the contents of the current string object are (partially) copied into
        tt(argument). The actual number of characters copied is returned.  The
        second argument, specifying the number of characters to copy, from the
        current string object is required. No ti(ASCII-Z) is appended to the
        copied string but can be appended to the copied text using an
        idiom like the following:
        verb(
    argument[object.copy(argument, string::npos)] = 0;
        )
       Of course, the programmer should make sure that tt(argument)'s size is
        large enough to accomodate the additional 0-byte.)
    ithtq(c_str)(char const *c_str() const)
       (the contents of the current string object as an ASCII-Z terminated
        bf(C)-string.)
    ithtq(data)(char const *data() const)
       (the raw contents of the current string object are returned. Since this
        member does not return an ASCII-Z terminated bf(C) string (as
        tt(c_str) does), it can be used to retrieve any kind of information
        stored inside the current string object including, e.g., series of
        0-bytes:
       verb(
    string s(2, 0);
    cout << static_cast<int>(s.data()[1]) << '\n';
        )
        )
    ithtq(empty)(bool empty() const)
       (tt(true) is returned if the current string object contains no data.)
    ithtq(erase)(string &erase(size_type opos, size_type on))
       (a (sub)string of the information stored in the current string object
        is erased.)
    ittq(string::iterator erase(string::iterator begin, string::iterator end))
       (the parameter tt(end) is optional. If omitted the value returned by
        the current object's tt(end) member is used. The characters defined by
        the tt(begin) and tt(end) iterators are erased. The iterator tt(begin)
        is returned, which is then referring to the position immediately
        following the last erased character.)
    ithtq(find)(size_t find(string const &argument, size_type opos) const)
       (the first index in the current string object where tt(argument) is
        found is returned.)
    ittq(size_t find(char const *argument, size_type opos, size_type an) const)
       (the first index in the current string object where tt(argument) is
        found is returned. When all three arguments are specified the first
        argument em(must) be a tt(char const *).)
    ittq(size_t find(char ch, size_type opos) const)
       (the first index in the current string object where tt(ch) is found is
        returned.)

        refers to the first index in the current string object where the
        search for tt(argument) should start. If omitted, the string object is
        scanned completely.  If tt(an) is provided it indicates the number of
        characters of the tt(char const *) argument that should be used in the
        search. It defines a substring starting at the beginning of
        tt(argument). If omitted, all of tt(argument)'s characters are used.)
    ittq(size_type find_first_of(char ch, size_type opos))
       (the first index in the current string object where character tt(ch) is

       (Note: this is em(not) a member function of the class tt(string).nl()
       A line of text is read from tt(istr). All characters until
        tt(delimiter) (or the end of the stream, whichever comes first) are
        read from tt(istr) and are stored in tt(object). If the delimiter is
        encountered it is removed from the stream, but is not stored in
        tt(line).nl()
       If the delimiter is not found, tt(istr.eof) returns tt(true) (see
        section ref(IOSTATES)). Since streams may be interpreted as tt(bool)
        values (cf. section ref(IOSTATES)) a commonly encountered idiom to
        read all lines from a stream successively into a string object
        tt(line) looks like this:
       verb(
    while (getline(istr, line))
        process(line);
        )
       The contents of the last line, whether or not it was terminated

        capacity, not of actually making available the memory to the
        program. This is illustrated by the exception thrown by the string's
        tt(at()) member when trying to access an element exceeding the
