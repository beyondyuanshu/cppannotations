Earlier in the annotations() (section ref(EMPTYTHROW)) we hinted at the
possibility of designing a class tt(Exception) whose tt(process) member
would behave differently, depending on the kind of exception that was
thrown. Now that we've introduced i(polymorphism) we can further develop this
example.

It will probably not come as a surprise that our class tt(Exception) should be
a polymorphic base class from which special exception handling classes can be
derived. In section ref(EMPTYTHROW) a member tt(severity) was used offering
functionality that may be replaced by members of the tt(Exception) base class.

The base class tt(Exception) may be  designed as follows:
        verbinclude(polymorphism/examples/exception.h)
    Objects of this class may be inserted into tt(ostream)s but the core
element of this class is the virtual member function tt(action), by default
rethrowing an exception.

A derived class tt(Warning) simply prefixes the thrown warning text by the
text tt(Warning:), but a derived class tt(Fatal) overrides
tt(Exception::action) by calling hi(terminate)tt(std::terminate), forcefully
terminating the program.

    Here are the classes tt(Warning) and tt(Fatal)
        verbinclude(polymorphism/examples/warning.h)
        verbinclude(polymorphism/examples/fatal.h)

When the example program is started without arguments it will throw a
tt(Fatal) exception, otherwise it will throw a tt(Warning) exception. Of
course, additional exception types could also easily be defined:
        verbinclude(polymorphism/examples/emptythrow.cc)
